Smart Contract Lottery 

This lottery contract is from the Cyfrin Updaft course. I’m using it my own way to study, build scripts, and write tests to make sure I really understand how it works.

Key Goals:

Random winner selection via Chainlink VRF

Deploy & interact with scripts

Tested for reliability
