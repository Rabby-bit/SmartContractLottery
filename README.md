Smart Contract Lottery

This project is based on the Cyfrin Updraft Smart Contract Lottery, but the implementation here is my own study-driven rebuild.

Instead of just watching the course and nodding, I’m:

Writing my own deployment & interaction scripts

Building tests to break and verify the contract

Re-implementing logic until it clicks

The goal isn’t originality — it’s deep understanding.

🚀 Key Features

🎲 Provably fair winner selection using Chainlink VRF

🛠️ Custom Foundry scripts for deployment and interaction

✅ Thorough testing to ensure reliability and correctness

🧠 Why This Exists

Learning Solidity by doing > learning by watching.
This repo documents my journey of understanding smart contracts line by line, not vibes only.
